Takeaways:
1. At first I didn't fully understand the point of opening apps or creating files/directories in terminal if I could do it all in Finder with a click of the mouse. After using it for a few days it's a lot faster!
2. I thought I'd be more comfortable with Zoom since I've been working remote for over a year (I primarily use Google Meet currently) but the combination of being unfamiliar with coding and not as familiar with Zoom has made me feel a bit uneasy during classes.

Strategies:
1. Take hand-written notes even if I can find them online somewhere.
2. Reviewing class work and exercises before class sessions. That way I have the opportunity to digest the information before meeting with the class.
3. Ask questions even if it makes me feel uncomfortable. Collaborate!

Shoutout!
Before starting Mod 0 I participated in the first MASH Try Coding weekend so I got some exposure to different people at Turing. That weekend and now in Mod 0 I found Dan to be very insightful!
