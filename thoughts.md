Takeaways:
1. At first I didn't fully understand the point of opening apps or creating files/directories in terminal if I could do it all in Finder with a click of the mouse. After using it for a few days it's a lot faster!
2. I thought I'd be more comfortable with Zoom since I've been working remote for over a year (I primarily use Google Meet currently) but the combination of being unfamiliar with coding and not as familiar with Zoom has made me feel a bit uneasy during classes.
